### BkzLogger

App to store data about books you've read in plaintext markdown.
Goodreads-like functionality except for all the social stuff.
Integrates perfectly with your markdown notes in Obsidian or similar apps.

### Disclaimer

For me this is a project to learn and play with stuff, it's not a production app. Use at your own risk.
Commits making it closer to being usable are always appreciated. I may not care enough to implement the feature you want but enought to review and merge your PR.

### Developing

```npm run watch``` to run in dev mode

```npm run test``` to run e2e tests

```npm run compile``` to build for production
